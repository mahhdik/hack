      <h3>How it Started?</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">It was a fine morning at Lynn Rose school, about 10am. 
        The Janitor walked outside to empty out the trash and was taken aback
        To find out that there was a UFO outside.
        The Janitor rushed inside the building to tell everyone what had happened.

        It was a fine morning at Lynn Rose School, about 10 am. 
        The janitor walked outside to empty out the trash and was taken aback.
        To find out that there was a UFO outside.
        The janitor rushed inside the building to tell everyone what had happened.
        The aliens began to jump outside their spaceships to attack.
        Lynn Rose was 
        The principal rushed on the microphone and yelled out, “THIS IS A LOCKDOWN. IT IS REAL THIS TIME.” 
        But because of the panic in the hallway, no one could hear what she said.
        The aliens invaded the school, but luckily, one student (SKIB) had a translator from the alien language to English!
        He said in their language, “Please don't attack us through the device.”
        The aliens gave a grunt, and it came out of the translator as, “We came here to learn the ISP program.”
        It was said on our planet that if we came to Lynn Rose, we would be very smart.
        So, the next began learning at Lynn Rose.
